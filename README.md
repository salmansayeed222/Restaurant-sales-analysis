I'm excited to share with you my small-scale Excel restaurant sales project. I started by obtaining a sample dataset, utilising Excel's Power Query feature to clean it up.
This included cleaning, sorting, and verifying that no values were missing then loaded this refined dataset into Excel's data model making sure data is flawless.

Once the data was all set, I used Power Pivot to connect two Excel sheets together to bring all the important information into one place, making it easier to analyze.
With everything in one spot, I used PivotTables to find key insights about sales, order details, and popular items to get clear picture of how the restaurant was performing.

After finding these insights, I created an interactive dashboard using chats, PivotTables, slicers, timelines, and measures with DAX to make it easy to explore the data and understand important metrics.
Overall, this project provides valuable information about the restaurant's sales and orders from which we can see things like monthly, hourly, and daily order volumes, top-selling items, and customer behavior trends.
